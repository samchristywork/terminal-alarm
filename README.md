## Deprecation Notice

This repository is deprecated.

This was an attempt to create an alarm system using Rust and Linux design
principles like everything is a file, and timestamps measured in seconds, etc...
I wasn't as good at Rust when I started, and there are more natural ways to do
what I was trying to do than by encoding everything in the file system, so I'm
abandoning this project for now.
